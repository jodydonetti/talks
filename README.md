## 📺 Talks

Along the years I've been lucky enough to be invited to some conferences, shows or podcasts both online and around the world, of course to talk about all things caching and FusionCache.

Here you can find some of them, either in video form, as slides or both.

Maybe you'll find find them useful.

Here we go again: [On .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/on-net/) hosted me for a "one year later" episode.

I highlighted what happened since last year's episode, both in general in the world of .NET caching and in particular with FusionCache.

Spoiler: a lot!

## 🧑‍🏫 Courses

If you enjoyed my talks or like the FusionCache docs, you may like this too:

<div align="center">

[![Caching Course on Dometrain](images/dometrain-getting-started-cover.png)](https://dometrain.com/course/getting-started-caching-in-dotnet/?ref=jody-donetti)

</div>

I published [a course](https://dometrain.com/course/getting-started-caching-in-dotnet/?ref=jody-donetti) on Dometrain.

Mind you, it's not just about FusionCache but about caching as a whole: we'll go from the very foundations to pretty advanced topics and scenarios. We'll cover performance, robustness, resiliency and we'll see different real-world problems and, most importantly, solutions for them.

I tried condensing 20+ years dealing with caching in one place, all in an approachable way.
