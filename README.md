# ðŸ“º My Talks

Hello stranger!

Along the years I've been lucky enough to be invited to some conferences, shows or podcasts both online and around the world, of course to talk about all things caching and FusionCache.

Here you can find some of them, either in video form, as slides or both.

Maybe you'll find find them useful.

### NDC Copenhagen (2025)

### On .NET (2025)

Here we go again: [On .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/on-net/) hosted me for a "one year later" episode.

I highlighted what happened since last year's episode, both in general in the world of .NET caching and in particular with FusionCache.

Spoiler: a lot!

### On .NET (2024)

The fine folks at [On .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/on-net/) have been kind enough to invite me on the show and listen to me mumbling random caching stuff.

This is a very good introduction on the general approach and features of FusionCache, but also a useful overview of caching concepts in general.
